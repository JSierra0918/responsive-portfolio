            <p>Hello, my name is Jorge. I studied Game Design and Development with an emphasis on 3D Models - I haven't
                touched it in a long time, <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/sulfonicxeno/art/VW-Bug-453954117">but
                here's some work if you'd like to see.</a> For the past 5 years I have been working as a marketing
                assistant dealing with all digital facets for Neutronics Inc. I became interested in web design after
                having to delve into it for the company. We used the wordpress platform with the Divi plugin - this was
                a blessing and a curse as modifying anything against their template would require having to deep dive
                into child themes, php, and css. This helped me understand the concept of what web development is and
                what it takes. Frustration and all, I enjoyed the whole process.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm currently enrolled in the Penn LPS Full Stack Flex program to make web development my career.</p>
